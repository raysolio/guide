# Profile guide! (How to use my profile layouts!)
Just an explanation for people who don't know how to get the code of the profiles I've made! I hope this helps! :)
(Just a little heads up... I was making this before underneath the profile1 repository by accident and lost all of my progress because the files were both README.mds and that isn't allowed. This was made like maybe an hour or 2 later so some information might be incorrect. I'm trying my best to fill back in what I remember writing before.)

# #1
First, go to my main Github page. Once you're there, click on where it says "Repositories".

# #2
When you're on my Repositories page, click on the profile you want.

# #3
Before using the template, scroll down and read the "BEFORE USING TEMPLATE" section!

# #4
After reading the "BEFORE USING TEMPLATE" section and understanding it, scroll back up and click "README.md" (NOT the "Create README.md").

# #5
Once you're on the page, scroll/look underneath the contributors and find where it says the number of lines. There, you can click either the "Raw" or "Blame" buttons for the code.

# #6 - Raw
If you clicked "Raw", you will see this page.

Simply, select all the code except from the "BEFORE USING TEMPLATE" section and copy it. (MAKE SURE YOU ALSO SELECT THE CREDITS!)

Scroll down while selecting it so you get it all (other than "BEFORE USING TEMPLATE", pls make sure you have the credits selected too.) and copy it.

# #8
If you're new to Github and don't already have a README.md for your page already, go to your page, find this.

Click "Continue".

# #9
Once you're on the page, select all the existing text and delete it.

It'll look like this if you deleted it all.

# #10
Paste in the code & customize it!

Scroll down and click "Commit changes" once you're done editing it! (You can edit it again whenever you want!)

# #12
After you hit "Commit changes", you're done! You can go to your profile to see if you like it and you can always change it later!

# END
